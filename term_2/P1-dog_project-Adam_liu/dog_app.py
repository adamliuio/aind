# ### Why We're Here 
# 
# In this notebook, you will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app.  At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input.  If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.  If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.  The image below displays potential sample output of your finished project (... but we expect that each student's algorithm will behave differently!). 
# 
# ![Sample Dog Output](images/sample_dog_output.png)
# 
# In this real-world setting, you will need to piece together a series of models to perform different tasks; for instance, the algorithm that detects humans in an image will be different from the CNN that infers dog breed.  There are many points of possible failure, and no perfect algorithm exists.  Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!

# ## Step 0: Import Datasets
# 
# ### Import Dog Dataset
# 
# In the code cell below, we import a dataset of dog images.  We populate a few variables through the use of the `load_files` function from the scikit-learn library:
# - `train_files`, `valid_files`, `test_files` - numpy arrays containing file paths to images
# - `train_targets`, `valid_targets`, `test_targets` - numpy arrays containing onehot-encoded classification labels 
# - `dog_names` - list of string-valued dog breed names for translating labels

    dog_targets = np_utils.to_categorical(np.array(data['target']), 133)
    return dog_files, dog_targets


def use_folder(file_path):
    folder = "/".join(file_path.split("/")[:-1])
    if os.path.exists(folder) == False:
        os.makedirs(folder)
    return file_path


# load train, test, and validation datasets
base_folder = "/mnt/my_own_stuff/aind/" if socket.gethostname() == "monsta" else "/Users/hongru.liu/Documents/ml/ai_nd/term_2/P1-dog_project-Adam_liu/"
train_files, train_targets = load_dataset(base_folder + 'dogImages/train')

# ### Import Human Dataset

# <a id='step1'></a>
# ## Step 1: Detect Humans
# 
# We use OpenCV's implementation of [Haar feature-based cascade classifiers](http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_face_detection.html) to detect human faces in images.  OpenCV provides many pre-trained face detectors, stored as XML files on [github](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades).  We have downloaded one of these detectors and stored it in the `haarcascades` directory.
# 
# In the next code cell, we demonstrate how to use this detector to find human faces in a sample image.

# In[4]:

import cv2                
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# In[5]:

cascade_folder = "/Users/hongru.liu/anaconda/share/OpenCV/" if socket.gethostname() == "AMAC02V401WHTDG" else "/home/ubuntu/anaconda3/share/OpenCV/"



# # Show some faces

# In[7]:



# Before using any of the face detectors, it is standard procedure to convert the images to grayscale.  The `detectMultiScale` function executes the classifier stored in `face_cascade` and takes the grayscale image as a parameter.  
# 
# In the above code, `faces` is a numpy array of detected faces, where each row corresponds to a detected face.  Each detected face is a 1D array with four entries that specifies the bounding box of the detected face.  The first two entries in the array (extracted in the above code as `x` and `y`) specify the horizontal and vertical positions of the top left corner of the bounding box.  The last two entries in the array (extracted here as `w` and `h`) specify the width and height of the box.
# 
# ### Write a Human Face Detector
# 
# We can use this procedure to write a function that returns `True` if a human face is detected in an image and `False` otherwise.  This function, aptly named `face_detector`, takes a string-valued file path to an image as input and appears in the code block below.

# In[8]:

# returns "True" if face is detected in image stored at img_path
def face_detector(img_path, detector="haar"):

    # extract pre-trained face detector
    if detector == "haar":
        face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cascade_folder + 'haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml')
    elif detector == "lbp":
        face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cascade_folder + 'lbpcascades/lbpcascade_frontalface_improved.xml')

    img   = cv2.imread(img_path)
    gray  = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray)

    return len(faces) > 0


# ### (IMPLEMENTATION) Assess the Human Face Detector
# 
# __Question 1:__ Use the code cell below to test the performance of the `face_detector` function.  
# - What percentage of the first 100 images in `human_files` have a detected human face?  
# - What percentage of the first 100 images in `dog_files` have a detected human face? 
# 
# Ideally, we would like 100% of human images with a detected face and 0% of dog images with a detected face.  You will see that our algorithm falls short of this goal, but still gives acceptable performance.  We extract the file paths for the first 100 images from each of the datasets and store them in the numpy arrays `human_files_short` and `dog_files_short`.
# 
# __Answer:__
# 
# ```
# There are 99% human photos detacted to have human.
# There are 11%   dog photos detacted to have human.
# ```

# In[9]:



# In[10]:

dog_files_short   = train_files[:100]
human_files_short = human_files[:100]

# Do NOT modify the code above this line.
## TODO: Test the performance of the face_detector algorithm 
## on the images in human_files_short and dog_files_short.

human_in_human = 0
human_in_dog   = 0

for i in range(len(human_files_short)):
    
    h, d = human_files_short[i], dog_files_short[i]
    if face_detector(h) is not False:
        human_in_human += 1
    if face_detector(d) is not False:
        human_in_dog += 1

print("There are {}% human photos detacted to have human.".format(human_in_human))
print("There are {}%   dog photos detacted to have human.".format(human_in_dog))


# __Question 2:__ This algorithmic choice necessitates that we communicate to the user that we accept human images only when they provide a clear view of a face (otherwise, we risk having unneccessarily frustrated users!). In your opinion, is this a reasonable expectation to pose on the user? If not, can you think of a way to detect humans in images that does not necessitate an image with a clearly presented face?
# 
# __Answer:__
# 
# 
# ```
# My opinion on this is to let users upload whatever images they want, let the algorithm detect if there is any face in the image, then give the feedback to the user.
# 
# And, give users the choice of correcting the result came out of the algorithm: for instance, if there are faces in the image that the algorithm did not identify, the user can point the faces out for us to capture the data for future training and improvements.
# ```
# 
# We suggest the face detector from OpenCV as a potential way to detect human images in your algorithm, but you are free to explore other approaches, especially approaches that make use of deep learning :).  Please use the code cell below to design and test your own face detection algorithm.  If you decide to pursue this _optional_ task, report performance on each of the datasets.

# <a id='step2'></a>
# ## Step 2: Detect Dogs
# 
# In this section, we use a pre-trained [ResNet-50](http://ethereon.github.io/netscope/#/gist/db945b393d40bfa26006) model to detect dogs in images.  Our first line of code downloads the ResNet-50 model, along with weights that have been trained on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/), a very large, very popular dataset used for image classification and other vision tasks.  ImageNet contains over 10 million URLs, each linking to an image containing an object from one of [1000 categories](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a).  Given an image, this pre-trained ResNet-50 model returns a prediction (derived from the available categories in ImageNet) for the object that is contained in the image.

# In[13]:

from keras.applications.resnet50 import ResNet50

# define ResNet50 model
ResNet50_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')


# ### Pre-process the Data
# 
# When using TensorFlow as backend, Keras CNNs require a 4D array (which we'll also refer to as a 4D tensor) as input, with shape
# 
# $$
# (\text{nb_samples}, \text{rows}, \text{columns}, \text{channels}),
# $$
# 
# where `nb_samples` corresponds to the total number of images (or samples), and `rows`, `columns`, and `channels` correspond to the number of rows, columns, and channels for each image, respectively.  
# 
# The `path_to_tensor` function below takes a string-valued file path to a color image as input and returns a 4D tensor suitable for supplying to a Keras CNN.  The function first loads the image and resizes it to a square image that is $224 \times 224$ pixels.  Next, the image is converted to an array, which is then resized to a 4D tensor.  In this case, since we are working with color images, each image has three channels.  Likewise, since we are processing a single image (or sample), the returned tensor will always have shape
# 
# $$
# (1, 224, 224, 3).
# $$
# 
# The `paths_to_tensor` function takes a numpy array of string-valued image paths as input and returns a 4D tensor with shape 
# 
# $$
# (\text{nb_samples}, 224, 224, 3).
# $$
# 
# Here, `nb_samples` is the number of samples, or number of images, in the supplied array of image paths.  It is best to think of `nb_samples` as the number of 3D tensors (where each 3D tensor corresponds to a different image) in your dataset!

# In[14]:

from tqdm import tqdm
from keras.preprocessing import image                  


def path_to_tensor(img_path):

    # loads RGB image as PIL.Image.Image type
    img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
    # convert PIL.Image.Image type to 3D tensor with shape (224, 224, 3)
    x = image.img_to_array(img)
    # convert 3D tensor to 4D tensor with shape (1, 224, 224, 3) and return 4D tensor
    return np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)


def paths_to_tensor(img_paths):

    list_of_tensors = [path_to_tensor(img_path) for img_path in tqdm(img_paths)]
    return np.vstack(list_of_tensors)


# ### Making Predictions with ResNet-50
# 
# Getting the 4D tensor ready for ResNet-50, and for any other pre-trained model in Keras, requires some additional processing.  First, the RGB image is converted to BGR by reordering the channels.  All pre-trained models have the additional normalization step that the mean pixel (expressed in RGB as $[103.939, 116.779, 123.68]$ and calculated from all pixels in all images in ImageNet) must be subtracted from every pixel in each image.  This is implemented in the imported function `preprocess_input`.  If you're curious, you can check the code for `preprocess_input` [here](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/applications/imagenet_utils.py).
# 
# Now that we have a way to format our image for supplying to ResNet-50, we are now ready to use the model to extract the predictions.  This is accomplished with the `predict` method, which returns an array whose $i$-th entry is the model's predicted probability that the image belongs to the $i$-th ImageNet category.  This is implemented in the `ResNet50_predict_labels` function below.
# 
# By taking the argmax of the predicted probability vector, we obtain an integer corresponding to the model's predicted object class, which we can identify with an object category through the use of this [dictionary](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a). 

# In[15]:

from keras.applications.resnet50 import preprocess_input, decode_predictions

def ResNet50_predict_labels(img_path):

    # returns prediction vector for image located at img_path
    img = preprocess_input(path_to_tensor(img_path))
    return np.argmax(ResNet50_model.predict(img))


# ### Write a Dog Detector
# 
# While looking at the [dictionary](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a), you will notice that the categories corresponding to dogs appear in an uninterrupted sequence and correspond to dictionary keys 151-268, inclusive, to include all categories from `'Chihuahua'` to `'Mexican hairless'`.  Thus, in order to check to see if an image is predicted to contain a dog by the pre-trained ResNet-50 model, we need only check if the `ResNet50_predict_labels` function above returns a value between 151 and 268 (inclusive).
# 
# We use these ideas to complete the `dog_detector` function below, which returns `True` if a dog is detected in an image (and `False` if not).

# In[16]:

### returns "True" if a dog is detected in the image stored at img_path
def dog_detector(img_path):
    
    prediction = ResNet50_predict_labels(img_path)
    return ((prediction <= 268) & (prediction >= 151))

# <a id='step3'></a>
# ## Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
# 
# Now that we have functions for detecting humans and dogs in images, we need a way to predict breed from images.  In this step, you will create a CNN that classifies dog breeds.  You must create your CNN _from scratch_ (so, you can't use transfer learning _yet_!), and you must attain a test accuracy of at least 1%.  In Step 5 of this notebook, you will have the opportunity to use transfer learning to create a CNN that attains greatly improved accuracy.
# 
# Be careful with adding too many trainable layers!  More parameters means longer training, which means you are more likely to need a GPU to accelerate the training process.  Thankfully, Keras provides a handy estimate of the time that each epoch is likely to take; you can extrapolate this estimate to figure out how long it will take for your algorithm to train. 
# 
# We mention that the task of assigning breed to dogs from images is considered exceptionally challenging.  To see why, consider that *even a human* would have great difficulty in distinguishing between a Brittany and a Welsh Springer Spaniel.  
# 
# Brittany | Welsh Springer Spaniel
# - | - 
# <img src="images/Brittany_02625.jpg" width="100"> | <img src="images/Welsh_springer_spaniel_08203.jpg" width="200">
# 
# It is not difficult to find other dog breed pairs with minimal inter-class variation (for instance, Curly-Coated Retrievers and American Water Spaniels).  
# 
# Curly-Coated Retriever | American Water Spaniel
# - | -
# <img src="images/Curly-coated_retriever_03896.jpg" width="200"> | <img src="images/American_water_spaniel_00648.jpg" width="200">
# 
# 
# Likewise, recall that labradors come in yellow, chocolate, and black.  Your vision-based algorithm will have to conquer this high intra-class variation to determine how to classify all of these different shades as the same breed.  
# 
# Yellow Labrador | Chocolate Labrador | Black Labrador
# - | -
# <img src="images/Labrador_retriever_06457.jpg" width="150"> | <img src="images/Labrador_retriever_06455.jpg" width="240"> | <img src="images/Labrador_retriever_06449.jpg" width="220">
# 
# We also mention that random chance presents an exceptionally low bar: setting aside the fact that the classes are slightly imabalanced, a random guess will provide a correct answer roughly 1 in 133 times, which corresponds to an accuracy of less than 1%.  
# 
# Remember that the practice is far ahead of the theory in deep learning.  Experiment with many different architectures, and trust your intuition.  And, of course, have fun! 
# 
# ### Pre-process the Data
# 
# We rescale the images by dividing every pixel in every image by 255.

# In[19]:

from PIL import ImageFile

# pre-process the data for Keras
train_tensors = paths_to_tensor(train_files).astype('float32') / 255
valid_tensors = paths_to_tensor(valid_files).astype('float32') / 255
test_tensors  = paths_to_tensor(test_files ).astype('float32') / 255

# The model uses the the pre-trained VGG-16 model as a fixed feature extractor, where the last convolutional output of VGG-16 is fed as input to our model.  We only add a global average pooling layer and a fully connected layer, where the latter contains one node for each dog category and is equipped with a softmax.

# <a id='step5'></a>
# ## Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
# 
# You will now use transfer learning to create a CNN that can identify dog breed from images.  Your CNN must attain at least 60% accuracy on the test set.
# 
# In Step 4, we used transfer learning to create a CNN using VGG-16 bottleneck features.  In this section, you must use the bottleneck features from a different pre-trained model.  To make things easier for you, we have pre-computed the features for all of the networks that are currently available in Keras:
# - [VGG-19](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG19Data.npz) bottleneck features
# - [ResNet-50](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogResnet50Data.npz) bottleneck features
# - [Inception](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogInceptionV3Data.npz) bottleneck features
# - [Xception](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogXceptionData.npz) bottleneck features
# 
# The files are encoded as such:
# 
#     Dog{network}Data.npz
#     
# where `{network}`, in the above filename, can be one of `VGG19`, `Resnet50`, `InceptionV3`, or `Xception`.  Pick one of the above architectures, download the corresponding bottleneck features, and store the downloaded file in the `bottleneck_features/` folder in the repository.
# 
# ### (IMPLEMENTATION) Obtain Bottleneck Features
# 
# In the code block below, extract the bottleneck features corresponding to the train, test, and validation sets by running the following:
# 
#     bottleneck_features = np.load('bottleneck_features/Dog{network}Data.npz')
#     train_{network} = bottleneck_features['train']
#     valid_{network} = bottleneck_features['valid']
#     test_{network} = bottleneck_features['test']
# 
# ---
# 
# ### (IMPLEMENTATION) Model Architecture
# 
# Create a CNN to classify dog breed.  At the end of your code cell block, summarize the layers of your model by executing the line:
#     
#         <your model's name>.summary()
#    
# __Question 5:__ Outline the steps you took to get to your final CNN architecture and your reasoning at each step.  Describe why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

# ### (IMPLEMENTATION) Predict Dog Breed with the Model
# 
# Write a function that takes an image path as input and returns the dog breed (`Affenpinscher`, `Afghan_hound`, etc) that is predicted by your model.  
# 
# Similar to the analogous function in Step 5, your function should have three steps:
# 1. Extract the bottleneck features corresponding to the chosen CNN model.
# 2. Supply the bottleneck features as input to the model to return the predicted vector.  Note that the argmax of this prediction vector gives the index of the predicted dog breed.
# 3. Use the `dog_names` array defined in Step 0 of this notebook to return the corresponding breed.
# 
# The functions to extract the bottleneck features can be found in `extract_bottleneck_features.py`, and they have been imported in an earlier code cell.  To obtain the bottleneck features corresponding to your chosen CNN architecture, you need to use the function
# 
#     extract_{network}
